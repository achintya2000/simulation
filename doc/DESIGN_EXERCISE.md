Two of us thought about using a 2-D array to represent the grid for the
simulation. One member thought about using a graph. Using a graph
could be advantageous because we could have the main node have connections
to the surrounding node so it'd be easier to find the state of the 
connections around it. The 2-D array would allow faster access to the data
and easier creation.
